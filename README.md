A pure AS3 components system for web/desktop development!(NOT FOR MOBILE)
------------------------------

Every component is designed to work independently, and most of them 
are just like Sprite,all the common operations(property manipulation,
lifecycle control,display list control,event system) should works fine
without additional works.But the whole system also offers funtionality 
to make life easier when building UI interfaces.

Details for this project(By which I mean docs and Wikis) will be added 
when most of the components(most of the frequently used) works perfectly
(or nearly),so for now,just check it out and try.
